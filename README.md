# The-Signup
This is a really simple project that uses the MailChimp API to collect email addresses and names of people. This page was made to see if I could make a signup section for a proper ecommerce website. Apparently, it works haha!


PS.- The files are in the master branch.

This projet is also active on the web (with the help of the heroku server). Here's the link :https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/sign-in/
