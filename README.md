# The-Signup
This is a really simple project that uses the MailChimp API to collect email addresses and names of people. This page was made to see if I could make a signup section for a proper ecommerce website. Apparently, it works haha!
This projet is also active on the web (with the help of the heroku server). Here's the link :https://guarded-dusk-98085.herokuapp.com/


PS.- The files are in the master branch.


Update 1: When submitting your email, you will get the error page because mailchimp has disabled my api key as it was available publically.
